### 📂 Projects

#### **🤖 Advanced AI Code Analyzer (Static Analysis & LLM)**
> *A production-ready Python code analyzer combining AST metrics with AI reasoning.*
* **The Goal:** Automate code quality assurance by merging deep static analysis with AI-powered refactoring suggestions.
* **How it works:** Parses Python AST to detect structural issues, runs security checks via `bandit`, and uses an LLM layer to explain complex bugs and suggest fixes.
* **Tech:** `Python` `AST` `LLMs` `FastAPI` `Bandit` `Radon`
* [View Repository](https://github.com/SameerShawareb/AI-Code-Analyzer)

#### **⚽ Smart VAR System (IoT & Embedded Logic)**
> *An automated hardware solution for real-time sports officiating.*
* **The Goal:** Automate offside detection in football using distance measurement logic.
* **How it works:** Uses an **Arduino** microcontroller with ultrasonic sensors to detect distance changes and triggers a servo-controlled visual alert.
* **Tech:** `C++` `Arduino` `Hardware Interrupts` `Sensors`
* [View Repository](https://github.com/SameerShawareb/Smart-VAR-Arduino)

#### **📅 Date Calculator (High-Level vs Low-Level)**
> *A comparative project in algorithmic logic.*
* **The Goal:** To translate complex high-level arithmetic logic into raw machine instructions.
* **How it works:** Implements the same date calculation logic in C++ and MIPS Assembly to demonstrate the differences in memory management and instruction processing.
* **Tech:** `C++` `MIPS Assembly` `Low-Level Logic`
